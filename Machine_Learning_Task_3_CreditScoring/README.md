# Credit Scoring Model — CodeAlpha Internship

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship** and implements a **Credit Scoring Model** to predict the creditworthiness of applicants using historical financial data.

##  Objective
Build a binary classification model that predicts whether a person has **Good Credit (1)** or **Bad Credit (0)** based on features like income, debt, credit history, and employment status.

- Features:
  - `income`
  - `debt`
  - `credit_history`
  - `employment_status`
  - `credit_score` (target)

## ️ Tech Stack
